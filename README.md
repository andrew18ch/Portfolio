## A first approach to combat Mechanics and Animations for RPG game classes
  This project was developed as a part of my Bachelor's thesis.It aims to have a first approach with the creation of the appropriate mechanics and animations for the combat system of specific role playing game(RPG) classes.The RPG classes that have been developed for this thesis are the warrior,mage and archer.The development of these classes has been based on styles and techniques of already existent and well-known RPGs.Except from the creation of the classes,another target was to understand the difficulties and requirements for RPG classes development.
  For the development of the project,it was used Unity with C# and Blender for the modelling and animating part.
## Scary atmospheric room
  The project was developed as a part of my MSc.The idea behind the scene that was created,is a scary atmospheric room.The room is the result of fire.That is the reason why there is nobody inside and there is an empty bed.However the doll that it is still there,reminds that people died there.For the development,it was used OpenGl with C++ and Blender for the modelling of the scene's objects.
